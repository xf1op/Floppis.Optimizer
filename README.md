# Floppi's Optimizer - Windows 10/11 optimization batch script.

A script that will optimize or rather TRY to optimize and enhance privacy of your system by changing various system and user based settings and registry keys. Feel free to give any suggestions for tweaks! I am trying my best to make it the best.

Main menu of the script.

Trying to make it simple and reliable.

## Purpose of the optimizer:
- Enhance your privacy (disabling tracking, telemetry, Recall, etc.)
- Change your interface (dark\light theme, etc.)
- Disable unnecessary settings 
- Optimize system functionality
- Save your bandwidth? (disabling windows update)

Why you shouldn't worry about viruses? Because code is free to check for viruses and i didn't implement anything malicious.
